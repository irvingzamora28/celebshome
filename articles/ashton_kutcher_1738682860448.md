# Ashton Kutcher Enjoys Rare Father-Son Night Out With Dimitri at WWE ‘Monday Night Raw’

Ashton Kutcher and his son Dimitri shared a heartwarming father-son bonding moment at WWE's "Monday Night Raw," held at the Intuit Dome in Inglewood, California, on January 6, 2024. The pair, who are known for their striking resemblance, showcased their shared enthusiasm for wrestling during this special outing.

## The Dynamic Duo

The event marked a rare public appearance for the Kutcher family, as Ashton, 46, and his 8-year-old son were seen cheering enthusiastically for the wrestlers. Kutcher, a proud native of Iowa, sported a laid-back look with a University of Iowa Hawkeyes T-shirt and a baseball cap, while Dimitri mirrored his dad's style with his own Hawkeyes jersey and a black hoodie. This outing highlighted not just their shared love for wrestling but also their familial bond.

## A Family of Sports Fans

The Kutcher family is not new to the sports scene. Just a few months prior, in May 2024, Ashton and his wife Mila Kunis made a rare public appearance together with both of their children, Wyatt and Dimitri, to watch WNBA star Caitlin Clark in action. Their family outing to see the Indiana Fever face the Los Angeles Sparks was memorable, with Kunis even wiping away tears from Wyatt’s face after the young girl met her basketball idol.

## Parenting Quotes from the Kutchers

Ashton and Mila have shared many relatable and humorous insights into their parenting style over the years. Mila once described them as “very goofy parents," candidly admitting, “I think that’s just [us] being idiots.” Kutcher added a light-hearted note about reading to their daughter in different character voices, noting, “Sometimes I try to read our daughter’s books in the characters’ voices, and she’s like, ‘Dad, can you just use your real voice?’”

## Balancing Parenting Styles

In a conversation about parenting dynamics, Ashton mentioned the influence of “toxic masculinity” on his approach. He expressed a different attitude toward his son and daughter, saying, “With my son, I’m always like, ‘Yeah, let’s go for it.’” In contrast, he admitted to being more protective of his daughter, sharing that when she cries, “my heart is out of my body and I can’t put it back in.” He noted that he and Mila balance each other out in their parenting styles, with Mila being stricter with their daughter while being more lenient with their son.

## Conclusion

The father-son outing at WWE "Monday Night Raw" serves as a reminder of the importance of family time and the unique bond shared between parents and their children. Ashton Kutcher and Mila Kunis have managed to keep their family life relatively private, but when they do step into the public eye, they always manage to capture the hearts of fans with their relatable and genuine parenting moments. As they continue to support their children's interests, it’s clear that their love for each other and their family remains at the forefront of their lives.
